## üöÅ Project Overview

The FENNEC Data Clipping Tool is a specialized software designed for the FENNEC Senior Design project at Letourneau University (2023/2024). This tool provides an efficient method for importing and analyzing MAVLink `.bin` files from the Goblin Raw 420 model helicopter.

Our goal is to provide a robust, user-friendly platform for our project team and stakeholders to extract valuable insights and usable dataframes from flight data, enhancing the overall understanding and performance of our aerial systems.

## ‚ú® Features

- **High-fidelity Data Processing**: Accurately parse and process MAVLink `.bin` files for detailed analysis.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Generate comprehensive visual representations of flight paths and accelerometer data.
- **User-Centric Design**: Intuitive interface and controls ensure ease of use for all user levels.
- **Versatile Data Export**: Export processed data in multiple formats for extended utility and compatibility.

## üõ† Getting Started / Installation and Setup

These instructions will guide you through the setup process to get the FENNEC Data Clipping Tool up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine.

### Required Python Packages

Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```sh
pip install flask flask-cors pandas werkzeug pymavlink requests openpyxl xlsxwriter flask_socketio simplejson pytz tables scipy
```

### Running the Server

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jaedync/fennec-clip.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```sh
cd fennec-clip
```

3. Run `backend.py` to start the server:

```sh
python backend.py
```

Your server should now be running at http://localhost:5000 and ready to accept MAVLink `.bin` files for processing. 
**Note:** If you need to access the server from a computer outside your local network, you can set up port forwarding on your router. However, the setup for port forwarding varies based on your router model and network configuration, and thus is outside the scope of this brief guide. Ensure to follow your router's instructions and understand the security implications of port forwarding.

## üìä Usage

To utilize the tool, perform the following steps:

1. **Upload Logs**: Select your `.bin` file via the upload button.
2. **Visualize and Analyze**: Observe as the tool charts out the flight path and sensor metrics.
3. **Select Data Range**: Use the timeline to select the start and end points of your data.
4. **Export**: Choose your desired format and export the data for further analysis.
